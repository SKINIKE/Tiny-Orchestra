# Tiny Orchestra â€“ Product Requirements (Phase 0 snapshot)

This document tracks the high-level goals for Tiny Orchestra. During Phase 0 the focus is on establishing the scaffolding that future DSP and sequencing features will rely on.

- Cross-platform desktop application built with Tauri and React.
- Core audio, sequencing, and rendering logic extracted into testable TypeScript packages.
- End-to-end testing via Playwright to ensure the editor shell stays functional.

Later phases will expand this document with concrete acceptance criteria for the tracker, DSP engine, export pipeline, and accessibility requirements.
